open-close-mask.jsx
===================

![gif ani](screenrec-ocmask.gif)  

This is a AE script to open and close several masks at once. If you want more control over mask check out [Shapes and Masks](http://aescripts.com/shapes-and-masks/) by [Michel Pensas](http://aescripts.com/authors/m-p/michel-pensas/)   

### Hint  
Hold the alt key while clicking and the script will ignore the settings and always close the mask.

### To Dos
- Remve the checkbox and work only with a button and the alt key. For this the whole panel must be aware of the pressed key so the message on the button can be updated.
